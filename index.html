              <p>
                The drying and firing process takes 14 days in our studio. From
                7-10 days, the product is dried on the shelf, then we dry it in
                the oven so that all moisture evaporates from the product and
                only then we burn it. Each firing takes 2 days. After the first
                firing, we cover the products with glaze and bake them again at
                a high temperature to obtain products that can then be used as
                dishes.

              <summary>How long does it take to pick up the items?</summary>
              <p>
                You can pick up the products after firing (14 days) within 1
                month in our studio. On weekdays from 10: 00-19: 00, weekends
                10: 00-13: 00. After a period of 1 month, we are forced to
                dispose of the products in the centers with which we cooperate
                and donate them to charity. Therefore, we recommend that you
                find the time and on time to pick them up, or we offer to
                arrange delivery via courier service for a separate payment to
                the door of the address you specified.

              <summary>And what is the difference between the programs</summary>
              <p>
                All participants have one program, the only thing they will
                differ in is that with firing in 1 stage or 2 stages. What does
                it mean with or without glaze coating. In the number of products
                and additional time for a circle.

              <summary>What is glaze and can other products be glazed?</summary>
              <p>
                Glaze is a glassy coating that requires high temperature oven
                baking in 2 steps. Plus, the product covered with glaze can be
                used as a dish and liquid can be poured into the product. You
                can cover the rest of the products with glaze, if you wish, for
                a separate payment (on average, for products with mk 200s /
                piece)
