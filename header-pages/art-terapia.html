    <h1>Art Therapy</h1>
    <p>
      Working with clay calms the nerves well and soothes. This is great art
      therapy. Psychologists say that a person who is in an aggressive state,
      while working with clay, finds a way out to his negative feelings, and
      people who are insecure learn to control the situation.

      By the way, clay helps a restless and restless person learn to concentrate
      well - so there is benefit for everyone☝! In the course of classes, a
      person gets a unique opportunity not only to create unspiritual clay
      objects, but also to breathe life into them✨.
